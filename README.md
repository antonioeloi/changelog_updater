A Python script to manage version updates and changelog entries in a standardized way. This tool helps maintain consistent changelog formatting while automating version increments and reference management.

## AI Assistance Notice

This project was developed with the assistance of Claude (Anthropic's AI). The AI helped with:
- Initial script structure and logic
- Error handling and edge cases
- Documentation and examples
- Best practices implementation

While the core requirements and testing were human-driven, the AI contributed significantly to the code implementation and documentation.

## Features

- Interactive CLI interface
- Automatic version increment for hotfixes
- Git branch detection for ticket IDs
- Standardized changelog entry formatting
- Automatic version reference management
- Duplicate removal and version sorting
- Repository URL agnostic

**You can see a complete example of the changes this script produces in [Pull Request](https://github.com/antonioeloi/changelog_updater/pull/1) where I run the demo.**

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `inquirer` package

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd changelog-manager
```

2. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install inquirer
```

3. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x script.py
```

## Usage

### File Structure
Your project should have:
- A `VERSION` file containing the current version number (e.g., "7.1.3.2")
- A `CHANGELOG.md` file following the Keep a Changelog format

### Running the Script

```bash
./script.py
```


### Interactive Prompts

1. The script will detect your current git branch and extract a ticket ID
2. Choose between:
   - Hotfix
   - Nope (cancels operation)
3. If Hotfix selected, choose the type of change:
   - Change
   - Feature
   - Fix
   - Remove
4. Enter your changelog message

### What the Script Does

1. Increments the last number in your VERSION file
2. Adds a new changelog entry with:
   - New version number
   - Today's date
   - Selected change type
   - Your message with ticket ID link
3. Updates version references at the bottom of the changelog
4. Sorts and removes duplicate references

## Configuration

The script uses these constants that you can modify:

```python
TICKET_PREFIX = "RAILS-" # Your ticket prefix
DEFAULT_TICKET = f"{TICKET_PREFIX}XXXX" # Default ticket format
CLICKUP_URL = "https://app.clickup.com/t/2477891/" # Your ticket system URL
```
